## &emsp My journal cover depicts my favourite sport: F1. But rather than the piece being one instance in F1's extensive history, it better alludes to certain aspects of the sport with personal resonance through subtle artistic diction.


### Why this car?

  I decided to draw Ferrari's 2005 car not because it was the easiest to draw, but because of the historical events that took place during that season. I will admit that while the artistic skill of the piece is nothing to talk about, I tried to connect to the idea of F1 with as much skill as I had. During the previous 2004 season, Michael Schumacher was by far seen as the most favourable driver to win the Championship, but he only did so 2 points ahead of then-rookie driver Kimi Räikkönen. Ferrari noted Kimi's potential, and in 2005 took the `risk` and signed him as a Ferrari driver. Despite being the driver with most Drivers' Championships in history, they replaced Schumacher with Kimi. Yet, the gamble paid off, as in his first year at Ferrari Kimi won his first Drivers' Championship. 

### The Driver  

  Additionally, Kimi would resonate with many `traits` that I value. For example, during this same season he would famously floor the gas pedal through a massive crash in front of him while blinded. Similarly, when I play chess I enjoy playing obscure and `risky` opening and strategies. This is the same reason why Hans Niemann is such an inspirational player to me: he sparked massive media spotlight by using an unconventional and underutilized strategy to beat the current World Chess Champion, Magnus Carlsen, something that not many players have accomplished.

### The Question of Future

  While I was thinking of the prompt "what will you be in the future", I struggled to narrow it down to a certain idea. Therefore, I thought it would be wise to make a more character-oriented piece: instead of "what will you do", "`who will you be`". As ascertained through this submission, I prize the ideas of skill, talent, creativity - all of which I see myself valuing in the future. Yet I recognize that they, despite their power, must be strung together by the uncertainty of `risk`. Despite never having taken an Arts class, I regardless chose to take the course simply because doing so would enable me to express the values I hold by pursuing complex and challenging subjects.
